## MINI-BIO

My name is Phuoc Kim Tran,  but I go by Haley. My pronouns are she, her, and hers. I am a 4th year undergraduate student at UC San Diego. I am in Warren College, majoring in Mathematics-Computer Science. I love learning new [languages](https://github.com/haleytran/haleytran.github.io/blob/main/index.md#languages-spoken) and engaging with new cultures through exploring their music and movies. I am interested in learning more about web development, AI, and machine learning.
